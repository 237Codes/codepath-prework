## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### A list of 3 of my favorite applications with 2-3 features of each

1. SendWave Money transfer app
   - Sending money seamlessly from one country to another.
   - Provide real-time currency conversion with the best market send rates.

2. Cryptocurrency Debit card app
   - Provide a digital card for online payments with cryptocurrency.
   - Link  external cryptocurrency accounts for centralized monitoring of all assets.
   - Transfer cryptocurrency between accounts.

3. Yelp 
   - Allows small business owners to manage appointments
   - Allows clients to book appointments for business services
   - Allows clients to review local businesses in an area
  
 I want to build a course app that allows students to review courses and professors in a given college and allows for video testimonials. The app will enable students to effectively select classes based on my school curriculum and suggest courses required to satisfy the gen ed requirements of a certain school. 

## Notes


Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. The UI initially felt strange finding where the buttons were. I needed a few tries to get used to it.
